# Javascript

### Node Installation

Much of the code in this lecture was run in the command line using node.js
Since most people will use javascript through a web browser, this step is completely optional, but if you want to make a server based on javascript or something, you may want to install node.

##### OSX

```
brew install node
```

##### Ubuntu and bash on Windows

```
curl -sL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_7.x | sudo -E bash -
sudo apt-get install -y nodejs
```

##### Normal Windows

Download the [installer](https://nodejs.org/en/#download).
